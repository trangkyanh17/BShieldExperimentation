# BShield Experimentation

This is the project where we do research and test some detection which BShield detect for their android mobile app.

## What's BShield

They explain more in their website <https://www.bshield.io/en>. Basically we can see that's the security solution company to protect their customer from attacks.

This project is already implemented in some vietnamee app like: VNeID, Techcombank, ...

## What we know about BShield android root detection

We can see more on [docs/DETECTION.md](docs/DETECTION.md)

## Project reclaim

You might see some BShield bypass module in Gitlab or Disroot by **Cuynu**. But the module is really from him but rather than a share from user named **@fukiame** on Telegam forward to (**@Jan** share our early development module to **@fukiame** before that)

What we want from here is not want him to shuffer with his action, but want him to return give back the development to us and remove his repo

For why I reclaim it, see [docs/RECLAIM.md](docs/RECLAIM.md)
