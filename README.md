## What is BShield?

BShield is a **comprehensive mobile security platform** that protects Android applications against threats, fraud, and unauthorized access. It offers continuous threat detection, device risk scoring, and multi-layered protection to ensure the safety of both users and businesses.

BShield is currently implemented in several leading Vietnamese apps such as VNeID, Techcombank, and others.
